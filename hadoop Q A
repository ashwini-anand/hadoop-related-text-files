*The piece of code by user is submitted to job tracker. Task trackers run the map and reduce code. Task trackers run on data node and hence mapper process is near to data(in most cases [sometimes mapper func for an input split may run on different machine than on which its input split is present beacause all machines having that input split is busy in doing map function for some other input split]) and saves a lot of network traffic.

*where does shuffling and sorting happens in hadoop?
shuffling is just transferring of data from mapper to reducer. sorting may happen both at mapper and reducer. --see and verify
